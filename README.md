# Face-recognition
face detection and recognition using opencv

Face detection:
The two face detection classifiers-

1)Haar:the haar cascade  classifier .xml file to be applied  for cv2.CascadeClassifier  function is also given
2)Lbp:the lbp cascade  classifier .xml file to be applied  for cv2.CascadeClassifier  function is also given
A test image test1.jpg is given as example. It can be replaced by any .jpg image,changing the parameters of multiscale function

Face-Recognition:

I used the Haar classifier for face detectiona nd then the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) Face Recognizer for the recognizer to tarin and predict the images

Using Convulsion Neural Network(CNN):

Here we use CNN for furthur accuracy and precision in identifying faces.More details are provided in the folder named Face_Recognition_CNN
