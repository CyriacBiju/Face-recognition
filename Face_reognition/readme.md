This is a self-project to train the images of the world-famous footballers-Lionel Messi and Christiano Ronaldo. I have used the Haar clasifier from the previos section for face detection.
The face recognizer is the Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) Face Recognizer and it can train the recognizer from the provided 6 image.
The test images are given in a different subfolder and we can predict face using the recognizer
